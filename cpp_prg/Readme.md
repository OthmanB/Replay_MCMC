# Instructions

Some C++ compiles programs must be put here in order to let the python3 codes run efficiently. 

	1. Ensure that you have compiled the TAMCMC program (see my github) following the instructions provided there

	2. Copy here the files bin2txt, getmodel and getstats that are generated by the TAMCMC program. These will be made in the ../TAMCMC-1.83.4/build directory if you followed the compilation instruction

	3. Copy here the models_ctrl.list file that is within TAMCMC/Config/default
